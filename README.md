# Multi-armed-bandits
A comparison of different algorithms for the multi-armed bandit problem.

This work was written in a spanish course as practice to write about a subject one is interested in, using academic spanish. The work compares different, simple but potential, algorithms to resolve a basic version of the k-armed bandit problem.
